Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that have garnered significant investor attention in the financial markets. The aim of this project is to predict the daily price, particularly the daily high and closing price, of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. This plays a vital role in making trading decisions. There exist various factors which affect the price of Bitcoin, thereby making price prediction a complex and technically challenging task. To perform prediction, we trained temporal neural networks such as time-delay recurrent neural networks (RNN) on historical time series â€“ that is, past prices of Bitcoin over several years. Features such as the opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, and volume of a currency over several preceding quartersweretakenintoconsiderationsoastopredictthehighestandclosingpriceofthefuture.
